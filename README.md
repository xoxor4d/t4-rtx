<h1 align="center">CoD-WaW (cod5) rtx-remix compatibility mod</h1>

<div align="center" markdown="1"> 

This client modification is made to make the game compatible with nvidia's [rtx-remix](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/rtx-remix).  
How? By manually reimplementing fixed function rendering :) 

It does __not__ come with a 'rtx mod' -> meaning no custom models nor materials.  

A demo mod can be found over at modDB: https://www.moddb.com/mods/cod5-nacht-der-untoten-demo

# Usage

#### A. Easy way but might not feature the latest and greatest:
  1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/xoxor4d/t4-rtx/releases) and extract the contents into your CoDWaW root directory.  
  The in-game console should show `t4-rtx-version >` if the dll was loaded correctly

<br>

2) Read the `Dvars / Console Commands` and `Current issues` sections

<br>

#### B. Manual way but always up-to-date:

1) Install the latest full rtx-remix release (0.4.0 at this time)   
https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/rtx-remix/tags

<br>

2) (Optional) Install the latest `github action` builds of:  
remix bridge - https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/bridge-remix/actions  
remix runtime - https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/dxvk-remix/actions  

<br>

3) Download the latest t4-rtx `github actions` build:  
  Release-binaries-t4-rtx - https://github.com/xoxor4d/t4-rtx/actions 
  - Drop `nvapi.dll` and the contents of the `assets` folder into your CoDWaW root directory and start the game.  
  The in-game console should show `t4-rtx-version >` if the dll was loaded correctly.

<br>

4) Read the `Dvars / Console Commands` and `Current issues` sections

<br>
<br>

## Dvars / Console Commands to further tweak the game to your liking:

> üî∏ skybox and fog settings can be tweaked per map by using `map_settings.ini` found in the `t4rtx` folder üî∏

- use console commands starting with `rtx_sky_` to spawn/change the skybox
- `r_forceLod` :: force all models to a specific LOD (highest by default)
- `r_lodScaleRigid` :: adjust static model draw distances (lower values increase draw distance)
- `r_aspectRatio` :: **AUTO** is truly auto now and supports any aspect ratio
- use console commands `noborder` & `windowed` to switch between borderless and normal windowed mode  
(set dvars `vid_xpos 0` and `vid_ypos 0` to put the window in the top left corner)
- `fx_cull_elem_draw_radius` :: fx elements inside this radius are not affected by culling (`fx_cull_elem_draw` needs to be enabled for this)

<br>
<br>

## Advanced Settings:

- A. Commandline Arguments:  
  - `-no_default_sky` :: disable spawning of a default sky on each map
  - `-stock_effects` :: render effects using shaders
  - `-no_fog` :: disable fog
  - `-no_forced_lod` :: do not set `r_forceLod` to `high` by default  
  
  > eg: &ensp;`c:\path\CoDWaWmp.exe -no_default_sky -stock_effects` 

  - Notes: 
    - `r_warm_dpvs` :: (1) disable all culling 
    - `r_warm_static` :: (1) unlimited draw distance for static models (not recommended, use `r_lodScaleRigid`)

<br>

- B. Console commands:  
  - `export_entities` :: export map entities and static models (misc_models) to `cod5root/t4rtx/entity-export/mapname.map`  

<br>



<br>

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current issues:
- fullscreen, changing resolution or anything else that requires the game to restart the renderer might crash the game
- effects will slow down the game (really depends on the effect and the amount - use `fx_enable 0` or `fx_cull_` dvars to adjust to your liking - marking certain effect textures as _ignore_ might help as well) 

<br>

## üí≠ Troubleshoot:
- game wont load or shows an error on startup?  
  - make sure you are on the latest version (1.7)
  - disable your onboard gpu (BIOS)
  - download a [debug build](https://github.com/xoxor4d/t4-rtx/actions) and watch for descriptive errors in the external console
  - try to run the game in windowed mode: 
    - use commandline arguments like `c:\path\CoDWaW.exe +set r_fullscreen 0`
	- or edit your player config (`appdata/local/Activision/CoDWaW/players/yourprofile`)

- captures loaded in the toolkit dont work correctly (UTF8 error), look [here](https://github.com/xoxor4d/t4-rtx/wiki/Home-%E2%80%90-General-Tips-%E2%80%90-Troubleshooting-%E2%80%90-etc)
- shadermodel 2.0 is not supported.

## Compiling yourself:
1. setup `COD5_ROOT` environment variable with path to your cod5 directory (optional)
2. run `generate-buildfiles_vs22.bat` to generate build files (build folder)
3. compile and copy `nvapi.dll` (renamed t4-rtx.dll) to your CoDWaW root folder  
   - ^ automatically happens if you setup `COD5_ROOT`
